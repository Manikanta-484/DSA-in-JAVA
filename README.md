# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Java implementations for various data structures and algorithms. Each topic is organized into its own directory, containing the relevant Java programs and examples.

## Contents

- [Array](#array)
- [ArrayList](#arraylist)
- [LinkedList](#linkedlist)
- [Queue](#queue)
- [Recursion](#recursion)
- [Stacks](#stacks)
- [Tree](#tree)
- [BinaryHeap](#binaryheap)

## Array

The `Array` directory contains Java programs demonstrating basic array operations, including initialization, traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching.

## ArrayList

The `ArrayList` directory includes programs showcasing the use of `ArrayList` in Java. Examples cover initialization, adding elements, removing elements, and various `ArrayList` methods.

## LinkedList

The `LinkedList` directory features Java implementations of singly and doubly linked lists. Programs include operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Queue

The `Queue` directory contains Java programs for different types of queues, including simple queues, circular queues, and priority queues. Examples demonstrate enqueue, dequeue, and other queue operations.

## Recursion

The `Recursion` directory provides examples of recursive algorithms in Java. Programs cover classic problems such as factorial, Fibonacci sequence, and more.

## Stacks

The `Stacks` directory includes Java implementations of stack data structures. Examples demonstrate push, pop, and peek operations, as well as applications of stacks.

## Tree

The `Tree` directory contains Java programs for various tree data structures, including binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees. Examples cover insertion, deletion, traversal, and balancing operations.

## BinaryHeap

The `BinaryHeap` directory features Java implementations of binary heaps, including both min-heaps and max-heaps. Programs demonstrate heap operations such as insertion, deletion, and heapification.
